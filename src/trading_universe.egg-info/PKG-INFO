# Trading Strategy Testing Universe

Opinionated, lightweight scaffolding for experimenting with trading strategies, evaluating key performance metrics, visualizing results, and running simple Monte Carlo bootstraps to probe outcome ranges.

## Quick start
1. Install dependencies (ideally in a virtualenv):
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Run the demo to see sample strategies, plots, and metrics:
   ```
   python -m examples.run_demo
   ```

## Structure
- `src/trading_universe/` – core library (backtester, metrics, plotting, strategies, monte carlo utilities).
- `examples/run_demo.py` – generates synthetic price data, runs a few strategies vs. buy-and-hold, prints metrics, and saves charts.

## Key features
- Pluggable strategy interface (`BaseStrategy`) so you can add many strategies.
- Core metrics: annualized return, volatility, Sharpe, Sortino, max drawdown, hit rate, profit factor, average gain/loss, alpha/beta vs. benchmark.
- Benchmark-aware backtesting to compare with simple buy-and-hold.
- Plot equity curves and drawdowns per strategy.
- Monte Carlo bootstraps on return streams to visualize payout dispersion.
